# Project Shopping Cart ðŸ›’

<p>This project is important to me because it marks the end of my fundamental studies and the beginning of learning the skills required to become a FrontEnd programmer.

During this project, we implemented new knowledge in JavaScript, including the use of APIs. The challenge was to build a fictional online store that sold products, using the Mercado Livre API and the Test Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

It was a very enriching experience to develop this project, as I was able to learn about what an API is and how to use an existing one, as well as improve my knowledge of testing and testing methodologies.</p>
